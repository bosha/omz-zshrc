To install, run the following command:

```bash
bash <(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bosha/omz-zshrc/master/install.sh)
```

This script will:

- Install Oh My Zsh if it isn’t already installed.
- Install the following plugins: **zsh-syntax-highlighting** and **zsh-autosuggestions**.
- Clone this repository to `~/.zsh-bosha`.
- Backup the existing `~/.zshrc` file generated by Oh My Zsh to `~/.zshrc.backup`.
- Create a symlink from `~/.zsh-bosha/zshrc` to `~/.zshrc`.

## Recommended Additional Installations

- `nvim`: Neovim—because Vim is great, but Vimscript isn’t.
- `eza`: A modern replacement for ls with icons and better defaults.
- `fd`: A faster and more user-friendly alternative to find.
- `yazi`: A powerful file manager.
- `fzf`: A fuzzy finder for quick and efficient file searching.
- `bat`: A cat replacement with syntax highlighting.

You can install these tools using Homebrew:
